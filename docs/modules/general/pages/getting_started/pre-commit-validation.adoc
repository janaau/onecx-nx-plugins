=== Set up pre-commit-validation

:idprefix:
:idseparator: -

The fastest way to validate code changes for linting issues, conventional commits messages, and potential secrets in the code is by using the OneCX generator.
include::partial$generator-check.adoc[]

******
To run the generator, execute the following command: 
----
nx generate <namespaceOfTheGenerator>/nx-plugin:pre-commit-validation
----

include::partial$generator-namespace-item.adoc[]

TIP: Next, the CLI will ask if you want to enable validation checks with three questions: Lint-check, Conventional Commit message check and scanning for blacklisted words in the code.
For each check, you can choose "yes" or "no". If "yes" is selected, the CLI installs the necessary dependencies and generates the required configuration files for the enabled validation checks.
Now the enabled checks are automatically performed before the changes can be committed.
